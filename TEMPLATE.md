I'm a London-based Engineering Lead; passionate about building simple, Test-Driven products and the teams to deliver them. Oh, and also about building the simple, Test-Driven, Open Source tools to power them. 

My latest coding passion is Kotlin, in which I created [http4k](https://http4k.org), the Functional toolkit for building Kotlin HTTP applications, which was lauded in the ThoughtWorks TechRadar. They said:

I'm also active as speaker at various international technology conferences and have also enjoyed developing and delivered Coding Dojos and full Training Courses, both in London and around the world.

Below is the history of my programming languages; I've been on a typical polyglot journey and worked in many industries, from Banking to Government to Internet Provision to Academic Publishing:
